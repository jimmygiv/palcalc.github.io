# ðŸ§¬ Palworld IV Breeding Calculator
A simple and intuitive web-based calculator to help Palworld players optimize their Pal breeding for desired Individual Values (IVs). Understand the probabilities of your offspring inheriting high IVs across HP, Attack, and Defense, or achieving specific minimum targets for each stat.

## âœ¨ Features
Individual IV Input: Easily input the HP, Attack, and Defense IVs (0-100) for both parent Pals.

Customizable Target IVs: Set specific minimum desired IVs for the offspring's HP, Attack, and Defense.

Probability Calculation: Get instant probabilities for:

Each individual stat (HP, Attack, Defense) meeting or exceeding your target.

The overall chance of all three stats simultaneously meeting or exceeding their respective targets.

Clear & Concise Results: Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format with percentages.

Responsive Design: Works well on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and straightforward design with clear labels and input fields.

## ðŸŽ® How it Works (Palworld IV Mechanics)
This calculator is based on the community-researched mechanics for IV inheritance in Palworld breeding:

Each of the three IVs (HP, Attack, Defense) is determined independently for the offspring.

For each individual IV stat, the child has:

30% chance to inherit the Father's IV for that specific stat.

30% chance to inherit the Mother's IV for that specific stat.

40% chance for a random roll of a value between 0 and 100 for that specific stat, irrespective of the parents' IVs.

The calculator takes these probabilities into account to determine the likelihood of your desired outcomes.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Input Parent IVs:

In the "Parent 1 IVs" section, enter the HP, Attack, and Defense IVs (0-100) for your first parent Pal.

Do the same for your second parent Pal in the "Parent 2 IVs" section.

Set Desired Offspring IVs:

In the "Desired Offspring IVs" section, enter the minimum IV score (0-100) you wish the child to have for its HP, Attack, and Defense stats. For example, if you want a Pal with at least 90 HP, 95 Attack, and 80 Defense, you would enter those values.

Calculate: Click the "Calculate Probabilities" button.

View Results: The "Calculation Results" section will display the probabilities for each individual stat and the overall probability of achieving all your desired minimum IVs.
